Hide/show/restrict elements based on user roles like administrator in WPBakery page builder (formerly Visual Composer).

== Description ==

This plugin adds settings to all elements in WPBakery page builder to hide/show the content elements on your website based on user roles. This way you can easily restrict content in WPBakery pages and posts.

For example you can hide a specific column element on your page or post for all users but editors or only show it to logged-out users.

By default (with no checkboxes checked) the content will be visible for all users.

The hidden content will also be removed from the HTML.

= Features =

* can hide content in the frontend for specific user roles and logged out users
* works with all WPBakery elements
* removes hidden content from HTML Code
* also works with added custom roles
* no hidden costs, completely free plugin

== Issues with specific Themes / Plugin versions ==

There are alot of themes that are using modified versions of WPBakery Page Builder. Some may not work together well with this plugin.

= Uncode Theme =

The Uncode WPBakery version did not show the tab Visible for roles at all. We fixed this by changing the hook when to add the our tab.

= Salient Theme =

The Salient Theme transforms checkboxes to switches and removes the labels. We fixed that in 1.2.1 and put the labels back there.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the zip to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Set the roles for which to hide the content in the WPBakery rows or columns settings
